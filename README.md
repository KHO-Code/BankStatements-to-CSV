# Instructions

(install related dependencies according to libraries)
Install Python3, Camelot, GhostScript, Pandas, Numpy

https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html

Install the solution file and the three pdfs (bankA, bankB, bankC)

(it is probably in the same directory but the pdfs must be in the same directory as the python file for the code to work)

Running the python file on terminal:

    change Directory(cd) to the 4 files
    python3 EasyTrackTask.py

    Type in one the following banks for example "bankA.pdf"
    in the input without the quotations.

    Repeat this process for the other two banks to recieve the solution files.
    (I would open the csv files through Microsoft Excel)
